# Getting Started
The short version contains everything you need to know to get started and search the database, create your own datasets, look for licence and citations and do basic transformations. The 'long' version contains all functionality, which can also be found via the help function.
Please note that our latest class 'MedShapeNet.Transformations' has not yet been integrated here but could be helpfull for transforming STL to Numpy or PLY and more specifically to binary masks with the grid size of your choice.
